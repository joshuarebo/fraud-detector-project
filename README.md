Fraud Detection System

This project is a machine learning-powered fraud detection system that identifies fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. It includes automated MLOps workflows for seamless model training, deployment, and monitoring.

üöÄ Features

Machine Learning Model: Trained to detect fraudulent transactions.

RESTful API: Serves real-time fraud predictions.

MLOps Pipeline: Integrated with MLflow for experiment tracking.

Automated CI/CD: GitHub Actions automates testing and deployment.

Logging & Monitoring: Requests and model performance are logged.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

MLOps Integration

MLflow: Tracks experiments, model versions, and logs performance.

GitHub Actions: Automates testing, model training, and API deployment.

Logging: API requests and responses are logged for analysis.

üìà Monitoring & Scaling

Model Monitoring: MLflow logs model performance metrics.

Scalability: Ready for cloud deployment using AWS/GCP/Azure.

Containerization: Can be deployed via Docker & Kubernetes.
